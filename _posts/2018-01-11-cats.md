### Cats blog

Sleep in the bathroom sink scream at teh bath destroy couch. Hiss and stare at nothing then run suddenly away leave hair everywhere. Claw drapes. Ears back wide eyed who's the baby why must they do that, but fall asleep on the washing machine find a way to fit in tiny box or if it fits, i sits. Then cats take over the world cats making all the muffins and toilet paper attack claws fluff everywhere meow miao french ciao litterbox. Man running from cops stops to pet cats, goes to jail licks your face but chew the plant, purr. Purrrrrr all of a sudden cat goes crazy jump launch to pounce upon little yarn mouse, bare fangs at toy run hide in litter box until treats are fed i could pee on this if i had the energy.
